# Ununenniumx86
A x86 version of Ununennium (0.5, by @nuclear-nfs)

# Keep in mind
The BSOD will not work (it is already defined and used)<br>
I mainly fixed bugs and errors for Visual Studio users. So do not expect the changes to be compilable in MinGW<br>
I did modify a few things. Like sound 2 actually working for example.

# Safe?
Nope, not at all. Safe may come soon.
